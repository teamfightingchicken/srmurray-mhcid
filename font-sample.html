    <h1> Romeo and Juliet </h1>
    <h2> by mark knopfler </h2>
    
    <div class="juliet">A love struck romeo</div>
    
    <p class="lyric">
    Sings the streets a serenade<br/>
    Now he's laying everybody low<br/>
    He's got a love song that he made<br/>
    He finds a streetlight<br/>
    And he steps out of the shade<br/>
    And says something like<br/>
    "you and me, babe, how about it?"<br/>
    </p>  
  

    
    <div class="juliet"> Juliet says "Hey, it's Romeo!"</div>
    
    <p class="lyric">
    "You nearly give me a heart attack!"<br/>
    Yeah well, he's underneath the window<br/>
    Now she's singing "Hey-la, my boyfriend's back"<br/>
    "You shouldn't come around here<br/>
    Singing up at people like that<br/>
    Ah anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?"<br/>
    </p>

    
    <div class="juliet">Juliet</div>
    The dice were loaded from the start<br/>
    <p class="lyric">
    And I bet and you exploded into my heart<br/>
    And I forget, I forget the movie song<br/>
    When you gonna realize<br/>
    It was just that the time was wrong<br/>
    </p>
