    <h1> Romeo and Juliette </h1>
    <h2> by Mark Knopfler </h2>
    
    
    <p>
    A love struck romeo
    Sings the streets a serenade
    Now he's laying everybody low
    He's got a love song that he made
    He finds a streetlight
    And he steps out of the shade
    And says something like
    "you and me, babe, how about it?"
    </p>  
  
    <p>
    Juliet says "hey, it's romeo!"
    "you nearly give me a heart attack!"
    Yeah well, he's underneath the window
    Now she's singing "hey-la, my boyfriend's back"
    "you shouldn't come around here
    Singing up at people like that
    Ah anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?"
    </p>

    <p>
    Juliet
    The dice were loaded from the start
    And I bet and you exploded into my heart
    And I forget, I forget the movie song
    When you gonna realize
    It was just that the time was wrong
    </p>
